## Skills

#### Team Player & Independent worker

Starting from my teenage years joining various basketball teams and playing sports in general, doing projects in teams throughout college years, working in a team in different professional settings and going through Makers highly selective full stack software engineering bootcamp, I learned what it is to be a team player and the importance of roles in each team. From identifying my own and my team members strengths and weaknesses, goals we are striving to achieve and doing the required individual work independently in order to be able to add valuable contributions to the team/project. These skills were put into practice in my second makers group project [ **Acebook** ](https://github.com/LeroyHJ/acebook) while learning new technologies/languages we have never done before. As a team we planned and came up with an effective strategic plan that we were able to execute smoothly. We identified eachothers knowledge, understanding and abilities and matched eachother in a pair where one would cover the others weakness. In this case more specifically i took on the leadership role on the front end technology and took who ever i was paired with under my wing. This allowed me to excercise my understanding and abilities in front end languages while sharing my knowledge to my team members. Once taking on the responsibility for the front end development of the project, I independently recapped what i had learned and went through and learned concepts such as Grid and Flexbox to apply into our projects.

#### Discipline

Since my teenage years striving to become the best basketball player i could be, I had alot of motivation and passion for the sport where i spent alot of hours daily practicing and improving my game. But there were still days when the training became repetitive, motivation was not high, i just coudnt deal with the thought of someone somewhere else outworking me to achieve the same goals so i still went and did the training. This in essence created consistency in my training and improvement in my basketball development/skills. Fast forward 3months of hard work and consistency i finally reaped the fruits of my labour, saw and felt the improvement of my training. Becoming one of the best players of all teams i joined there after, I knew this was only because i had developed a discipline of still going forward on days when i didnt feel like it. When ever i make a plan to achieve something i reflect on this time of my life to execute the same level of discipline.
